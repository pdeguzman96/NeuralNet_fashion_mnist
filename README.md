# Neural Network Evaluation on Fashion-MNIST

Fashion MNIST is a well-known dataset containing many images of 10 categories of clothing. It's meant to be a more challenging replacement to the numeric MNIST dataset.

In my notebook, I manually created several PyTorch neural networks with several hyper parameters & evaluated all of them on the MNIST dataset.

Thanks!
